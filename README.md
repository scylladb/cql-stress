# Cql Stress

A benchmarking tool for Scylla/Cassandra, written in Rust, offering a command line interface compatible both with [cassandra-stress](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/tools/cassandra_stress.html) and [scylla-bench](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-bench/).
The aim of the tool is to provide a more scalable and performant replacements of the original tools, and increase the usage of scylla-rust-driver in tests.

The `scylla-bench` frontend is feature-complete, `cassandra-stress` is a _work in progress_.

## Usage

`cql-stress` is not published on crates.io yet, therefore in order to use it you need to clone it and build from source.
See the [Development](#development) section for more details.

## Crate features

List of the crate features:
- `user-profile` - enables support for `user` command and custom user profiles in `cassandra-stress` frontend. This feature is enabled by default. To disable it, pass `--no-default-features` flag when building the tool.

### Scylla Bench

See the documentation of the original [`scylla-bench`](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-bench/blob/master/README.md#usage) for a comprehensive explanation of the most important parameters.
To see a list of all the parameters currently supported by the tool, use `cql-stress-scylla-bench -help`.

### Cassandra Stress

See the documentation of the original [`cassandra-stress`](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/stable/cassandra/tools/cassandra_stress.html) for a comprehensive explanation of the most important commands and options.

To see a list of all commands and options currently supported by the tool, use `cql-stress-cassandra-stress help`. To see a list of parameters supported for a given command/option, use `cql-stress-cassandra-stress help <command/option>`.

#### Populating the cluster

To populate a local cluster, make use of `write` command:
```
cql-stress-cassandra-stress write n=1000000 -pop seq=1..1000000 -rate threads=20 -node 127.0.0.1
```

Since some of the options and parameters were not provided, the tool will make use of some default values. This will result in:
- creating a `keyspace1` keyspace (if not exists)
- creating a `keyspace1.standard1` table (if not exists)
- populating the table with 1000000 generated rows

#### Validating cluster contents after write

To validate that the data inserted in the previous step is correct, make use of `read` command:
```
cql-stress-cassandra-stress read n=1000000 -pop seq=1..1000000 -rate threads=20 -node 127.0.0.1
```

#### User profiles

Commands mentioned above are very limited. They do not, for example, allow to test other native types than `blob`.

To test more complex schemas, make use of user profiles (`user` command). User profiles allow to define custom schemas and custom statements used to stress the database.

Users can define custom statements via user profile yaml file. See the exemplary yaml files under `tools/util/profiles`. The path to profile file can be provided via `profile=` parameter of `user` command.

Notice that the tool reserves an `insert` operation name and predefines the behaviour
of this operation. User can execute this operation (with a given sample ratio weight)
by providing it to `ops()` parameter along with other operations defined by the user in the yaml file. This operation will simply generate and insert a full row to the stressed table. It's analogous to `write` command - the only difference is that it operates on the custom schema.

To enable the `user` mode, the tool needs to be compiled with `user-profile` feature. This feature is enabled by default.

## Development

### Prerequisites

You need the `cargo` command and OpenSSL development libraries to build the tool.

**Install system dependencies:**

On Ubuntu/Debian/Linux Mint:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install libssl-dev pkg-config
```

On Fedora/RHEL/CentOS:
```bash
sudo dnf install openssl-devel pkg-config
```

On macOS:
```bash
brew install openssl pkg-config
```

### Building

```bash
# The --release flag can be omitted when developing features and testing them,
# but don't forget to include it when building for benchmarking purposes
cargo build --release
```

Then, run the frontend of your choice:

```bash
./target/release/cql-stress-scylla-bench <arguments>
./target/release/cql-stress-cassandra-stress <arguments>
```

Alternatively you can combine compilation and running in a single step:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin cql-stress-scylla-bench -- <arguments>
cargo run --release --bin cql-stress-cassandra-stress -- <arguments>
```

### Running tests

The easiest way to set up the necessary environment and run the tests is to use the `tools/test_with_scylla.py` script.
The script requires Python 3, Docker and Docker Compose V2 in order to work.
It will run a Docker container with Scylla and will automatically remove after the tests have completed.

Alternatively, you can set up Scylla yourself and keep it up between test runs. The easiest way to do it is by using Docker:

```bash
# Downloads and runs Scylla in Docker
docker run --name scylla-ci -d -p 9042:9042 scylladb/scylla
```

Then, you can run the tests like this:

```bash
cargo test -- --test-threads=1
```

If you are using a non-standard IP address or port for your Scylla instance, you can pass it through the `SCYLLA_URI` environment variable:

```bash
SCYLLA_URI=172.16.0.1:9042 cargo test -- --test-threads=1
```

#### cassandra-stress frontend python tests
To run the test cases used during CI (defined in `./tools/cassandra_stress_ci.py`), you can make use of [pytest](https://pytest.org).
Before running the tests, make sure you have scylla up and running.
If you use some non-standard scylla URI, you can specify it via `SCYLLA_URI` env variable.
```bash
docker compose -f docker/scylla_test/compose.yml up -d --wait
export SCYLLA_URI="127.0.0.1:9042"
pytest -s ./tools/cassandra_stress_ci.py
```
